          <h3>CHEM01 : Novel delivery systems for preservation agents</h3>
          Develop novel delivery systems for preservation agents to ensure controlled release and prolonged effectiveness. Traditional preservation methods often involve the direct addition of preservatives or antimicrobial agents to food matrices, which may result in uneven distribution or rapid depletion of the active compounds. To address these challenges, develop delivery systems that can ensure the controlled release of preservation agents over time, thereby prolonging their effectiveness.

          <h3>CHEM10 : Production of slow-release fertilizers using encapsulation techniques</h3>
          Design a process for the production of slow-release fertilizers using encapsulation techniques, such as coating nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) compounds with biodegradable polymers or nanostructured materials, to improve nutrient efficiency and reduce nutrient leaching. Traditional fertilizers often release nutrients rapidly upon application, leading to potential nutrient leaching, volatilization, and inefficient nutrient uptake by plants. Slow-release fertilizers offer a solution by releasing nutrients gradually over an extended period, matching plant nutrient demands and reducing environmental impacts.
