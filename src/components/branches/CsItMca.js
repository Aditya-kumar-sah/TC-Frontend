                <h3>MCSIT01:  Real-time Enemy Detection and Localization</h3>
                Navigating the chaos of a modern battlefield is a constant struggle. Traditional methods like radar and visual scouting are often limited, leaving soldiers vulnerable to hidden threats. The ability to accurately and instantly identify enemy locations and distances in real-time would be a game changer, offering a critical tactical advantage.
