            MME01 : Dust-Repellent Thin-Film Coating for Solar Cells{" "}
          </h3>
          Solar cell efficiency can be significantly reduced by dust and dirt accumulation on their surface. Frequent cleaning can be expensive and impractical in remote locations. The goal is to create a surface coating for solar cells that repels dust and dirt particles, minimizing maintenance and maximizing energy output.

            MME02 : Green Iron and Steel Production{" "}
          </h3>
          The Steel industry is a significant contributor to global carbon emissions. Traditional methods of steel production rely heavily on coal as a reductant, which results in greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution. With increasing environmental regulations and the urgent need to combat climate change, there is a pressing need to develop more sustainable methods of iron and steel production.

            META07 : Advanced Biocompatible Material for Enhanced Biofluid Diagnostics{" "}
          </h3>
          Accurate detection and analysis of biomarkers in biofluids such as blood, saliva, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are essential for early disease diagnosis and effective monitoring. However, these biomarkers often face degradation and interference within biofluids, leading to unreliable diagnostic results. There is an urgent need for innovative materials that can protect these biomarkers from degradation, selectively capture them, and possess antimicrobial properties. Such materials would significantly enhance diagnostic precision and efficiency across a range of biofluids, paving the way for improved healthcare outcomes.
